# Automatic Path Remembering and Retracing Metal Detecting Bluetooth-Controlled Vacuum Robot

## **Project Overview**

This project involves an Arduino-based Bluetooth-controlled vacuum robot that can remember and retrace its path. The robot is designed for metal detecting and is capable of moving autonomously to cover areas while detecting metals in its environment. The project combines path-following and metal detection to offer a unique solution for cleaning and detecting metal objects.

## **Necessary Files**

1. **Arduino Code (file: `arduino_code`)**  
   This file contains the necessary code to control the robot's movement, Bluetooth communication, metal detection, and path memory. The code is written in Arduino IDE and can be uploaded directly to the Arduino board.

2. **Circuit Diagram (file: `circuit`)**  
   The circuit diagram provides a detailed overview of the connections needed for the project. It includes components such as the Arduino, Bluetooth module, motors, metal detector, and other essential peripherals.

## **Project Setup**

1. Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board.
2. Follow the circuit diagram to wire all the components correctly.
3. Use a Bluetooth module for wireless communication with a mobile or PC application to control the robot.
